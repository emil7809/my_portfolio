<h2>What am I doing?</h2>

<p>I design websites, with everything that entails.</p>
<div class="per"><p> I'm a student, not a wizard. But my strengths are the following. 
</p> </div>
<p> <br><br> Do you need professional pictures for your website?</p>
<div class="per"><p>I got you.</p></div>
<p>How about a video for your campaign?</p>
<div  class="per"><p>No problem!</p></div>
<p>Need some digital art to make your site pop?</p>
<div class="per"><p>Yes ma’am.</p> </div>
<p>Would you like some one of the kind animations to your buttons? I do it all. <br> 
    And anything I don't know, I am eager to learn. <br>
</p>
<div class="per"><p>Just don't give me the responsibility to keep a plant alive. That I cannot do. It will die.</p> </div>
<br>
<p>I’m a creator, and I live for creating new things. This is the reason I chose Frontend design. While I could create a stunning website with Wordpress, I seek boundless opportunities to create, and I would rather know and understand how to build a website up from scratch, so the only limit is my imagination.  <br>
    That being said, because I have this tendency to make things unnecessarily complicated, I have acquired and tested my problem-solving skills regularly. I have experience in finding creative solutions with the tools I am given, and because of my vast, relatively speaking, knowledge of coding, I have more tools to work with.</p>
<div class="per"><p>Also I’m stubborn and don’t know when to quit. I won't stop until I find a solution.  
<br>
<br>
    For instance, for my English exam I had to talk about English history and culture, so I talked about English humor and spent my reading vacation watching Monty Python. I got The highest grade.

    <h2>Why though?</h2>
    <div class="per"><p>What am I working towards? You want the truth? I’m not sure. I’m pushing 30 and this terrifies me.</p> </div>
    <p>I know that this is the only thing I can see myself doing for the rest of my life.</p>
    <div class="per"><p>I mean, I found the holy trinity! I love it, I’m good at it and I can build a career doing it.</p> </div>
    <p>I see myself working in design, breaking the boundaries and finding new and creative ways, and stepping away from overused solutions.</p>
    <div class="per"><p>I cannot abide flat design, and I can't wait for this design phase to go out of fashion and we can all look back and be like: "lol what were we thinking?" 
    </p> </div>
    <p>I want to do that coding with raw HTML CSS and a little JS, and I am ready to learn a new coding language. I wouldn't mind working with Worpres or another website builder, but I do prefer raw coding. 
    <br>
    I want to have an influence on design, whether that is making a new theme for a website, or building one up from the bottom.
    <br>
    I can make good content for a site, and I want to be given the responsibility to make it.  
    <br>
    <br>
    But I need help figuring out where to apply my devotion and skill.
    I want to improve people's lives, doing what I love with something that captivates me.
    </p>
    <div class="per"><p>Take a look at my <a href="#fun">Fun Facts</a> list to get an idea of things that could captivate me.
        <br>
        I am not fearless, I am brave. 
        </p> </div>
    <p>My mind is ready to be molded into exactly what you need.</p>
    <div class="per"><p>While still being me.</p></div>

    <div id="how_p">
    <h2>But how?</h2>
    <p>Currently I’m in my third semester on KEA, studying Multimedia Design with focus on Frontend design.</p>
    <div class="per"><p>Having only gotten the highest grades, I work hard to keep that ball rolling.</p></div>
    <p>Here I have not only expanded my creating skills, but also learned how to research a client's needs and market, and form educated ideas for my designs. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I have worked as a photographer for the online auction house Lauritz.com and for the nightclub Penthouse.
    I have an eye for capturing beauty, in even the most mundane things. 
    </p>
    <div class="per"><p>When I was younger and less educated, I thought I was going to be a film director, so</p></div>
    <p>I have made a lot of videos throughout my 27 years. This has given me the experience to make professional videos, fast, as well as manage multiple tasks simultaneously. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I first got my hands on Photoshop in 2009, and I have been using it regularly since. With it I have the ability to transform the simple into the extravagant! 
    </p>
    <div class="per"><p>I also use it to draw all kinds of things, like characters from my D&D sessions, abstract interpretations of how I'm feeling, symmetrical owls and so on.</p></div>
